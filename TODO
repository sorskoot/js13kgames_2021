Must have:
    Initial:
        ☐ A name
        ✔ Build pipeline @done(21-08-16 22:19)
    ✔ Enter VR Button @done(21-08-27 22:16)
    ✔ Movement in VR @done(21-08-28 20:34)
        ✔ teleporting. @done(21-08-28 20:34)
    Push cubes to target:
        ☐ check if target is reached
        ✔ move boxes @done(21-08-29 13:05)
    ✔ Level generator @done(21-08-27 21:20)
    ☐ Be very easy to restart levels    
    ☐ 5 levels.
    ☐ Menu
    ☐ Title Screen


Should have:
    ☐ Handle multiple boxes, prevent boxes from overlapping
    ☐ store progress when leaving game
    ☐ Must have 10 levels.
    ☐ particles:
        ☐ when you hit a cube
        ☐ when you hit the target
        ☐ on the target

Could have:
    ☐ animating textures, like last year.
    ☐ bigger FOV on desktop
    ☐ Movement by walking
    ☐ Have the game run on the desktop
    ☐ Step/teleport onto the walls (maybe by rotating the whole world)
    ☐ Must have 20 levels.
    ☐ powerups
    ☐ teleporting
    ☐ gravity fields
    ☐ lighting

Would like:
    ☐ Must have 50 levels.

Bugs: 
    @critical:
        ☐ reset camera after leaving XR
    @high:
        ☐ prevent player from teleporting into walls
        ☐ prevent player from moving box by pointing though walls or over them
            ~ maybe add an invisible wall above other blocks to prevent this

Story:
    ~ Janitor on space ship. The ship is a mess, boxes all over the place.
    ~ You need to clean up the mess of boxes and place then into the right spots.
    ~ Gravitiy is only working on your boots. The boxes slide forward and only stop when hitting 
    ~ a wall or column. You can't jump over the boxes. 
    ~ But, we can jump on the walls.    

Levels:
    S = Start
    B - Box
    T - Target
    1 - wall type 1, etc
    0 - empty space
    
    ~ Level 1:
      [1,1,1,1,1,1,1],
      [1,S,0,0,0,0,1],
      [1,0,1,0,0,0,1],
      [1,0,B,0,0,T,1],
      [1,0,1,0,0,0,1],
      [1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
      [1,1,1,1,1,1,1],
    ~ Level 2:


    ideas:
        - Add transparent textures close to the walls to give it a more 3D look.
