Story:
    ~ Janitor on space ship. The ship is a mess, boxes all over the place.
    ~ You need to clean up the mess of boxes and place then into the right spots.
    ~ Gravitiy is only working on your boots. The boxes slide forward and only stop when hitting 
    ~ a wall or column. You can't jump over the boxes. 
    ~ But, we can jump on the walls.    

Levels:
    S = Start
    B - Box
    T - Target
    1 - wall type 1, etc
    0 - empty space
