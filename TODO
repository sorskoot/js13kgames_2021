    ☐ animating textures, like last year.
    ☐ bigger FOV on desktop
    ☐ Movement by walking
    ☐ Have the game run on the desktop
    ☐ Step/teleport onto the walls (maybe by rotating the whole world)

    ☐ teleporting
    ☐ gravity fields
    ☐ lighting

Would like:

Bugs: 
    @critical:
        ✔ reset camera after leaving XR @done(21-09-02 22:38)
        ✔ Reposition camera when going to the next level @done(21-09-02 19:14)
        ✔ Make the boxes color individualy @done(21-09-02 22:47)
    @high:
        ☐ prevent teleportation when moving a box.
        ✔ prevent player from teleporting into walls or over them @done(21-09-02 19:14)
            ~ the issue seems to change when after teleporting one time. The first time it works fine, then is it wrong. 
        ✔ prevent player from teleporting into the small space behind the box @done(21-08-29 13:38)
        ☐ prevent player from moving box by pointing though walls or over them
            ~ maybe add an invisible wall above other blocks to prevent this
            ~ when 2 boxes are next to each other, you can't move them
    @low:
        ☐ teleporting next to box should be possible more often
        ☐ prevent player from walking through walls in VR
        ☐ Make game work with levels with odd Width and Height

Story:
    ~ Janitor on space ship. The ship is a mess, boxes all over the place.
    ~ You need to clean up the mess of boxes and place then into the right spots.
    ~ Gravitiy is only working on your boots. The boxes slide forward and only stop when hitting 
    ~ a wall or column. You can't jump over the boxes. 
    ~ But, we can jump on the walls.    

Levels:
    S = Start
    B - Box
    T - Target
    1 - wall type 1, etc
    0 - empty space
    
    ~ Level 1:
      [1,1,1,1,1,1,1],
      [1,S,0,0,0,0,1],
      [1,0,1,0,0,0,1],
      [1,0,B,0,0,T,1],
      [1,0,1,0,0,0,1],
      [1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
      [1,1,1,1,1,1,1],
    ~ Level 2:


    ideas:
        - Add transparent textures close to the walls to give it a more 3D look.
