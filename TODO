Should have:

    Do we really need to support the 'touch' things?

    ☐ powerups
    ☐ teleporting
    ☐ gravity fields
    ☐ lighting

Would like:

Bugs: 
    @critical:
        ✔ reset camera after leaving XR @done(21-09-02 22:38)
        ✔ Reposition camera when going to the next level @done(21-09-02 19:14)
        ✔ Make the boxes color individualy @done(21-09-02 22:47)
        ✔ Teleporting does not work all the time... @done(21-09-05 13:03)
        ☐ On desktop you have to first get focus befor you can start the game. This needs to be only one click, or with a differnt button
        ☐ Make sure title is in from of the camera when pausing
        ☐ Dont make sound if box cant move
    @high:
        ☐ prevent teleportation when moving a box.
        ✔ prevent player from teleporting into walls or over them @done(21-09-02 19:14)
            ~ the issue seems to change when after teleporting one time. The first time it works fine, then is it wrong. 
        ✔ prevent player from teleporting into the small space behind the box @done(21-08-29 13:38)
        ✔ prevent player from moving box by pointing though walls or over them @done(21-09-08 18:36)
            ~ maybe add an invisible wall above other blocks to prevent this
            ~ when 2 boxes are next to each other, you can't move them
    @low:
        ☐ teleporting next to box should be possible more often
        ☐ prevent player from walking through walls in VR (maybe add shapes to every block, to block ray)
        ☐ Make game work with levels with odd Width and Height


Story:
    ~ Janitor on space ship. The ship is a mess, boxes all over the place.
    ~ You need to clean up the mess of boxes and place then into the right spots.
    ~ Gravitiy is only working on your boots. The boxes slide forward and only stop when hitting 
    ~ a wall or column. You can't jump over the boxes. 
    ~ But, we can jump on the walls.    

Levels:
    S = Start
    B - Box
    T - Target
    1 - wall type 1, etc
    0 - empty space
    
    ~ Level 1:
      [1,1,1,1,1,1,1],
      [1,S,0,0,0,0,1],
      [1,0,1,0,0,0,1],
      [1,0,B,0,0,T,1],
      [1,0,1,0,0,0,1],
      [1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
      [1,1,1,1,1,1,1],
    ~ Level 2:


    ideas:
        - Add transparent textures close to the walls to give it a more 3D look.
        
Notes:
    - best compression for zip, on linux => advzip -a -4 -i=5000 dist.zip index.html
    - base64 for image => https://base64.guru/converter/encode/image/webp
        - add "data:image/webp;base64," in front of the string
